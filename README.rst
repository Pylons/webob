WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses.  Specifically
it does this by wrapping the `WSGI <http://wsgi.org>`_ request
environment and response status/headers/app_iter(body).

The request and response objects provide many conveniences for parsing
HTTP request and forming HTTP responses.  Both objects are read/write:
as a result, WebOb is also a nice way to create HTTP requests and
parse HTTP responses.
